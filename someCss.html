    <h2>1. An external style sheet:</h2>
    <p>I use the external CSS to define the background colour as gray, the colour of text with "h1" size as dark green, and the colour of text with "h2" size as dark magenta.</p>
    <h2>2. A floated element:</h2>

        No trip to Maui would be complete without a trip to Haleakala National Park to watch the sun dance over the â€œHouse of the Sun."<br>
        That said, we are often asked: "Which is best: Haleakala sunrise or sunset?" The answer is: That depends.<br>
        Before we get into the pros and cons of each, allow us to tell you that whether you choose to get up with the stars and watch the sun rise, or stay late and watch the sun set, you simply cannot miss visiting the summit of Haleakala. There's a reason it's one of Maui's top attractions- the views are legendary, you'll have a chance to see rare plants and animals such as the nene (Hawaiian goose) and the silversword plant, and the landscape is simply otherworldly.<br>
        Most Haleakala visitors prefer to watch the sun rise; in fact, the overwhelming majority do. And among those who have had the good fortune to witness both, most pick the AM journey as their favorite.<br>
